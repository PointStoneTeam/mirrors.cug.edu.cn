Welcome to the Ubuntu Master Releases mirror rsync server.

This server is located in London, United Kingdom.

If you are not an Ubuntu official country mirror, please consider 
using a Ubuntu releases mirror closer to your physical location.

This server has limited resources.  A list of Ubuntu archive mirrors 
which support rsync can be found here:

If you host a Ubuntu mirror, public or private, please register your
mirror in Launchpad if you have not already done so.  

Registrations can be made here:

If you require assistance with your public mirror, please contact the
Ubuntu mirror team at the following address:
